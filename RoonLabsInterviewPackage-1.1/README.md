# Roon Labs Interview Package

We've created a set of three small projects that are designed to be fun while revealing your strengths and showing off your approach to development. You're free to do any or all of them, but each one requires slightly different skills, and we find that people tend to gravitate to one over the others. We encourage you to choose the one or two that jump out at you.

These aren't easy textbook tasks; each one could take from a few hours to a full day to complete. We know it's a lot to ask, but we're confident that we'll learn more about you by seeing your work than by putting you on the spot in a Skype interview. A complete solution to any of these projects tells us that you think about things the way we do, and that you'll be a good fit for our team.

1. Build a command-line reverse polish notation calculator (see rpn/README.md)
2. Build a simple wiki engine using modern web and devops tools (see wiki/README.md)
3. Get the classic arcade game Centipede bootstrapped inside a web browser (see centipede/README.md)

If you complete any of these projects, we guarantee that your work will be evaluated by a senior member of our engineering team, and that you'll receive comprehensive feedback.
